# Focus Roadmap

Living document for project progress. Updated as phases complete.

**Last updated:** August 2026  
**Current phase:** Phase **5 thin slice shipped** — batched inline PR review comments on changed lines (reuse `FocusHUD` captions; ROA-capped). Phase **4b core complete**; 4c/4d opt-in captions + ledger on PyPI 0.4.0. Check-run annotations + per-file headers remain Explore / deferred.

**Shipped to PyPI in `focus-hud` 0.4.0 (extension 0.6.0):**
- **#32 (Phase 4d)** — class-body constant assigns + Typer `@app.command` / Option help as caption purpose source.
- **#33 (Phase 4b)** — symbol-proven downstream filter (`src/focus/hud/symbol_filter.py`): blast rings filtered to files that actually import **and** call the changed symbol.
- **#34 (Phase 4c)** — tighter caption prompt/pack grounding; `prompt_rev=320-ground-v3`; default model stays `qwen2.5-coder:3b`.
- **#37 (Phase 4b)** — why-this-edge import jump: CodeLens jumps to the import line that proves a blast-radius edge (`ImportEvidence`).
- **#38 (Phase 4b)** — JSDoc/TSDoc extraction into `Definition.docstring` for JS/TS captions.
- **#39 (Phase 4b)** — roadmap honesty + ROA-caps guard tests.

> **Honesty:** #32–#39 are on GitHub `main` **and** shipped in `focus-hud` **0.4.0** on PyPI (`pip install "focus-hud>=0.4.0"`). VS Code extension is **0.6.0** — **not** on the Marketplace yet (held); sideload via `./scripts/install-extension.sh`.

---

## Product surfaces (agreed)

One computed `FocusHUD` — multiple renderers. **No committed HUD files in git.**

| Surface | What the user sees | In the repo? |
|---|---|---|
| **A — PR comment** | Full HUD markdown (summary + Mermaid + Danger Zones) on every PR | **No** — posted/updated via GitHub Action |
| **C — Inline in the diff** | Edit-shaped ℹ️ on changed lines while reviewing | **No** — IDE CodeLens + GitHub batched review comments (Phase 5 thin); blast radius stays in **A** |
| **B — Committed `.md`** | `focus-hud.md` checked into the tree | **Out of scope** — local/CI scratch only; gitignored |

```
pip install focus-hud
        │
        ├─ Before push (IDE)     → C: CodeLens + HUD panel in your working diff
        │
        └─ On PR (GitHub Action) → A: HUD comment (blast radius overview)
                                 → C: inline review comments on changed lines (Phase 5 thin)
```

---

## North star

**Simple but great:** one command (`focus trace auth_utils.py`) that shows real downstream blast radius on a real repo — not a platform with ten half-working language parsers.

| Ship | Defer |
|---|---|
| Python + JS/TS AST + dependency graph | Go, Rust, Java parsers |
| `focus trace` + `focus audit --local` | Cloud-hosted graph store |
| Mermaid HUD in CLI + PR comments | Interactive D2/SVG viewer |
| PR comment (A) + inline diff (C) | Committed `focus-hud.md` in git (B) |
| Smart triggers (no diagram fatigue) | ML-based trigger classifier |
| Evidence-based Danger Zones | Full points-to / data-flow analysis |
| Parse cache | LLM label pass (parked — hallucination risk) |
| PyPI (`focus-hud`) + drop-in Action | Marketplace listing polish |
| CLI `--format json` + IDE CodeLens MVP + GitHub inline review (Phase 5 thin) | Check-run annotations; per-file header comments |

---

### Phase 0 exit criteria

- [x] Trigger rules documented (`docs/TRIGGERS.md`)
- [x] Privacy + ethics principles documented
- [x] Explicit "won't build" list agreed
- [x] HUD schema frozen (`docs/HUD.md`)
- [x] Stack confirmation locked (`docs/STACK.md`)
- [x] Phase 1 step plan agreed (below)

---

## Phase 1 — Focus Scan (Python only) *(complete)*

**Goal:** Parse a Python repo and emit a dependency map for one file.

| Step | Deliverable | Tests added | Explain-back | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | `pyproject.toml`, Typer CLI, `focus scan` walks repo + respects `.gitignore` | `glass_box/` fixture, pytest harness, smoke tests | Parse pipeline diagram | ✅ |
| **2** | Python facts: defs, imports, call sites → in-memory index | `test_parser.py` — parametrize import/def cases | What AST nodes we extract | ✅ |
| **3** | NetworkX graph + `focus trace [file]` → text HUD (no Mermaid yet) | `test_graph.py`, `test_triggers.py`, parse → graph integration | Reverse edges, downstream list | ✅ |
| **4** | Mermaid renderer + HUD output | `test_hud_golden.py`, Mermaid validator, E2E CLI subprocess | Full HUD walkthrough | ✅ |

**Parser note (post–Phase 3):** Python extraction uses the stdlib **`ast`** module (Tree-sitter Python was dropped after real-repo segfaults). JS/TS still use Tree-sitter.

**Testing principle:** fixture and pytest land at Step 1; each step adds tests **with** the feature — see [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md).

**Constraints:**

- Full-repo parse (no diff-only blindspots)
- LLM optional in Phase 1 — labels can be static; topology must be computed
- One language until graph pipeline is proven

---

## Phase 2 — Blast Radius Engine *(complete)*

| Feature | Purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `focus audit --local` | Git diff → changed files → reverse BFS → HUD | ✅ |
| Danger Zone scorer | Flag API routes, schemas, high fan-out nodes | ✅ path + fan-out + `.focus.toml` |
| Smart triggers | Skip diagram for docs/comments/test/isolated | ✅ |
| Focus HUD v1 | Executive summary + Mermaid + bulleted blast radius | ✅ |
| IDE preview (`--out`) | Write HUD markdown for editor Mermaid preview | ✅ |
| Symbol-aware diff | Report touched defs; comments-only → pass-through | ✅ |

---

## Phase 3 — GitHub Action + multi-language *(complete)*

| Feature | Purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub Action | `focus audit` on PR open/sync → PR comment | ✅ |
| PR-range audit | `focus audit --base <sha>` uses `base...HEAD` | ✅ |
| Blast-radius signal polish | Quieter Danger Zones; reasons name real importers | ✅ |
| JS/TS Tree-sitter grammar | Web repo support | ✅ |
| Parse cache | File-hash keyed AST cache for speed | ✅ |
| PyPI publish (`focus-hud`) | `pip install focus-hud` — CLI remains `focus` | ✅ 0.1.0 |
| Drop-in Action for any repo | [`examples/focus-action.yml`](../examples/focus-action.yml) | ✅ |

LLM label pass was **removed from Phase 3** and parked (see below): Focus ships evidence-only HUDs so we never add model-generated copy that can hallucinate.

---

## Phase 4 — IDE (diff-first) *(in progress)*

**Goal:** Surface **C** locally — blast-radius context *in the diff you're editing*, not only in a side panel.

| Feature | Purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `focus … --format json` | Machine-readable `FocusHUD` for tools | ✅ 0.2.0 |
| VS Code / Cursor extension | Install via VSIX or `scripts/install-extension.sh` | ✅ MVP |
| CodeLens on changed / blast-radius files | Risk + downstream count at top of file | ✅ MVP |
| HUD webview panel | Same Mermaid + Danger Zones as CLI / PR comment | ✅ MVP |
| CodeLens on changed **lines/symbols** | True inline diff context (not just file header) | ✅ 0.2.1 |
| Gutter hop markers + “why this edge” | Click claim → import evidence | 🔄 gutter + showWhy; **import jump landed** (branch): file CodeLens jumps to the proving `import` line via `ImpactNode.import_evidence` |
| Inline symbol explanations | Stacked CodeLens `↳` captions on changed defs | ✅ branch |
| `focus explain --why` | CLI evidence trail (proven vs heuristic) per caption | ✅ branch |
| Marketplace publish | Easy install for strangers | Pending |

---

## Phase 4b — Explanation depth *(core complete — dynamic-import hints parked to Explore)*

**Goal:** Close the known gaps in deterministic explanations — still **no LLM** for dependency edges or captions. Guard **Return on Attention (ROA)**: every word Focus asks a human to read must earn its cost.

| Limitation today | Planned improvement | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Hunk copy names enclosing `def`** | Hybrid: structural cues → proven `CallSite` → text heuristics; skip plumbing callees | ✅ slice 1 |
| **Implication (who / what goes wrong)** | Computed on the symbol; shown in **HUD / JSON / PR** — not as a second CodeLens on `def` (ROA: one ℹ️ at the edit) | ✅ HUD; IDE rail removed (#30) |
| **CodeLens layout** | One ℹ️ at the body edit (docstring hunks deferred when body exists); hover = evidence | ✅ #30 |
| **File-level blast radius** | Symbol-level downstream (who calls *this* def, not just the file) | ✅ symbol-proven filter |
| **Static-only graph** | Best-effort dynamic import / string-literal hints where parseable | Explore |
| **Heuristic captions** when no docstring | ~~Typer `@app.command` metadata for CLI~~ *(done)*; ~~JSDoc/TSDoc extraction for JS/TS~~ *(done, #38)* | ✅ |
| **Evidence in IDE** | Hover = *why trust this* only (≤2 cues); no restating rail/ℹ️; importers collapsed → HUD | ✅ ROA slim |
| **Verbose / low-ROA copy** | Hard caps: max chars for ℹ️ / summary; one idea per lens; no restating the header | ✅ enforced in `explain.py` (260 explanation / 110 summary / 110 implication; ℹ️ slot clip 52; ≤2 inline evidence) |
| **PR comment inventory dump** | Cap **Your changes** at 8 + overflow; cap Also affected / Not pulled in at 8; prefer short detail over long explanation | ✅ focus-hud 0.3.4 |
| **Tiny diff, huge output** | Stronger triggers: tiny + low blast radius → pass-through or *tiny* HUD (see [`TRIGGERS.md`](TRIGGERS.md)) | ✅ pass-through (≤5 lines, &lt;2 downstream, no DZ/path/shared) |
| **Auto-refresh on save** | Quiet re-audit after saving a source file; CodeLens/gutters update in place (`focus.autoAuditOnSave`) | ✅ extension 0.5.1 |
| **SCM Working Tree CodeLens** | Same risk rail + ℹ️ on the **modified** side of local side-by-side diffs (`diffEditor.codeLens`) and the open file (`editor.codeLens`) | ✅ |
| **Edit-shaped captions** | Deterministic ℹ️ from the edit: blank counts, imports, calls, returns, assigns — not static slogans | ✅ focus-hud 0.3.2 / extension 0.5.2 |
| **Expression-slot captions** | Return/assign ℹ️ include a clipped expression when readable; weak/`None`/code-soup yield to purpose; opt-in LLM may polish from the pack | ✅ focus-hud 0.3.3 + 4c/4d |
| **Live-as-you-type** | Debounced refresh from the **unsaved buffer** (not only disk/git) — `--overlay-file` + `focus.liveBufferOverlay` | ✅ focus-hud 0.3.3 / extension 0.5.3 |
| **Evidence-pack LLM captions** | Opt-in labeler for **all** ℹ️ (incl. blank-line); pack-constrained; never invents edges; never on live overlay | ✅ focus-hud 0.3.5 / extension 0.5.4 |

**Pinned UX (IDE):** Rails and ℹ️ refresh while editing via buffer overlay (`focus.liveBufferOverlay`, default on). Save→auto-audit remains as a disk sync. Marketplace polish can follow once this feels instant in dogfood.

**Trust model:** every caption labels evidence as **proven** (parse/graph/diff) or **heuristic** (name/path rules / optional `llm_label`). `focus explain --why` shows the cite list today; IDE surfacing is next.

**Slice 1 concept:** a *call site* is where code invokes a name (`foo()`). Parser already records these. Hybrid order: structural cues (`kind=`) first, then proven overlapping calls, then weaker text heuristics.

**ROA (product rule, not a separate product):** Focus must never become the “1-line change + 1,430-character description” anti-pattern. Prefer silence or one sentence over filler. Virtual UI only — never write explainers into the repo.

---

## Phase 4c — Evidence-pack caption labeler *(shipped opt-in)*

**Goal:** When caption labeling is opt-in, an LLM may **relabel every ℹ️ from a `CaptionEvidencePack`** Focus already built — including blank-line captions — never invent topology. Fail-closed validate keeps the deterministic caption on reject.

| Knob | Default |
|---|---|
| `FOCUS_LLM_ENABLED` / `.focus.toml [llm] captions` | off |
| `FOCUS_LLM_PROVIDER` | `openai` (cloud) or **`ollama`** (no-key local dogfood) |
| `focus audit --llm-captions` | dogfood / CI force-on for one run |
| Extension `focus.llmCaptions` | false (explicit **Audit Local**: wait for open-file LLM before first paint, then label remaining files in background — never autosave / overlay) |

**Dogfood checklist (all captions when enabled, before leaving on by default):**

1. Unit grounding tests green (`tests/test_llm_labeler.py`).
2. **Preferred no-key path:** install [Ollama](https://ollama.com), `ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:3b`, local `.env` (never commit):
   ```
   FOCUS_LLM_ENABLED=true
   FOCUS_LLM_PROVIDER=ollama
   FOCUS_LLM_MODEL=qwen2.5-coder:3b
   ```
   Quality fallback: `qwen2.5-coder:7b`. Or cloud: `FOCUS_LLM_API_KEY` + `openai`/`anthropic`. Keep default off in committed configs.
3. One run: `focus audit --local --llm-captions` (no overlay). Every changed-symbol caption is a candidate; expect more LLM calls / latency than weak-only.
4. For each caption that gained `llm_label` evidence, score: invent entity? invent behavior not in pack? better than silence/deterministic?
5. Accept only if **zero** topology invent and no ungrounded scope/entity slips past validate; otherwise leave default off.

**Bake-off (3b vs 7b, evidence-only):** keep default `qwen2.5-coder:3b`; compare with `FOCUS_LLM_MODEL=qwen2.5-coder:7b` on the same diff. Clear caption cache between runs (`python -c "from focus.llm.cache import clear_caption_cache; clear_caption_cache(disk=True)"`). Prompt revision is fingerprinted (`320-ground-v3` as of caption-quality workstream).

---

## Phase 4d — Portable fact ledger for captions *(thin slice shipped)*

**Status:** Thin slice **on main** (2026-07 — #29 / related) — module-level assign + same-file readers + importers → template orphan captions; packs carry `readers` / `importers` / `reader_doc` for opt-in LLM polish. Kill-or-keep PASS on Focus + stranger fixture. **Class-body assigns + Typer `@app.command` help heuristic shipped** (`feat/ledger-heuristics`). JSDoc/TSDoc extraction shipped (#38).

**Problem dogfood surfaced:** Measured ℹ️ often names *edit shape* (`Updates \`weak_hit\` here.`, orphan “outside a function”) without *scope* (what changed in the target code, who uses it). An LLM can invent fluent scope; Focus must not. CEOs’ “AI replaces judgment” narrative does not license ungrounded captions.

**Constraint (non-negotiable):** The ledger is built from the **target codebase** Focus is analyzing — AST + diff + graph for *that* tree. No Focus-specific symbol dictionaries (e.g. special-casing `_WEAK_MARKERS`). The same algorithm must work on a stranger’s repo.

**Direction (ship order):**

1. **Generic edit facts** — ~~module-level assign + clipped RHS + same-file readers~~ *(done in `src/focus/hud/edit_facts.py`)*; ~~class-body assigns~~ *(done)*; more edit shapes later.
2. **Attach who** — ~~importers from `facts_by_path`~~ *(done for module names)*; expand as needed.
3. **Template captions** from those facts *(done for orphan module assigns)*.
4. **Opt-in LLM labeler** — orphan packs carry readers/importers/reader_doc; sweet-spot polish + 320-char budget (#30); still **never on live overlay**; Audit Local waits for open-file labels when enabled.
5. **First-class `EditFact` / `UseFact` / `ImpactFact` models** if the pack gets messy (defer).

**Success check:** On any repo, a module-level constant edit reads as defendable scope — not “Edited outside a changed function…” and not insider product jokes. *(Ledger thin slice verified: Focus `_WEAK_MARKERS` → `is_weak_caption` and stranger `RETRY_LIMIT` → `charge`.)*

---

## Phase 5 — GitHub inline diff *(thin slice shipped)*

**Goal:** Surface **C** on GitHub — pins on the PR **Files changed** tab, alongside existing **A** PR comment.

| Feature | Purpose | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Inline review comments on **changed lines** | Reuse edit-shaped ℹ️ (`hunk_details` / `line_explanations`) as one batched `COMMENT` review | ✅ thin slice (`src/focus/ci/github_review.py`) |
| Same `FocusHUD` as Action | `focus audit --format json`; A comment stays the blast-radius overview | ✅ |
| Per-file header comments | Risk tier / hop count on changed files | Deferred |
| Check-run annotations (optional) | File-level signals in Checks UI (can hit unchanged downstream) | Explore |

**A** (PR comment block) ships via [`examples/focus-action.yml`](../examples/focus-action.yml). **C** on GitHub layers on top — not a replacement. Unchanged downstream files stay in **A** only (GitHub review comments cannot anchor outside the diff).

---

## Explicitly out of scope (for now)

- **Committed HUD markdown in git** (`focus-hud.md` as a tracked artifact) — use PR comment (A) + inline diff (C) instead
- Diff-only analysis without full-repo graph context
- LLM inventing dependency edges / Mermaid nodes not in the computed graph
- **LLM free-summarizing hunks without an evidence pack** — v1 labeler is pack-constrained (Phase 4c); free prose remains won't-build
- Blocking PR merges or developer quizzes
- Developer surveillance, blame metrics, or performance scoring
- Interactive hosted code maps (CodeSee-style SaaS)
- PlantUML / D2 as primary output (Mermaid first; SVG fallback later)
- Sending full repository source to LLM APIs
- Covert repo analysis without workflow opt-in

Full ethics list: [`docs/ETHICS.md`](ETHICS.md)

---

## Parking lot — future ideas (unscoped, not promised)

- **Evidence-pack caption labeler (Phase 4c):** shipped opt-in in focus-hud 0.3.5 — labels all ℹ️ from capped edit packs when enabled; never invents edges. Free-form / topology LLM remains parked.
- **IDE extension (Phase 4 — deepen C):** symbol-level CodeLens, gutter hop colors, always-on watch, auditable “why this edge” deep links.
- **GitHub inline diff (Phase 5):** thin slice shipped — batched review comments on changed lines; check-run annotations + per-file headers still parking-lot.
- **More languages (Go / Rust / Java):** adoption breadth only — not the differentiator. Revisit when a real user is blocked without them.
- **Auditable “why this edge”:** click from HUD claim → import evidence (line). Trust theater → trust proof. **`focus explain --why`** ships on the inline-explanations branch; IDE deep-link next.
